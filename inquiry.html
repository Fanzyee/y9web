    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    
    <p>In the past decade, wealthy countries such as Canada have access to exceptional healthcare, whereas those living in poverty, areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa face deadly diseases; Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea, leading to dehydration and eventually death if untreated. It can be caused by consuming food or water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. It is one of the most potent diseases in the world today, as it presents an estimated burden of 1.4 to 4.0 million cases, and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths per year worldwide.</p>
    
    <h1>Justification</h1>
    
    <p>Currently the JSON data displayed on the WHO (World Health Organization) is not user friendly. To educate and raise awareness on the topic of Cholera, an interactive and user-friendly user interface will be created. Two-thirds of the cases and deaths as a result of Cholera occur in developing countries, mostly Sub-Saharan Africa. Raising awareness about diseases such as Cholera through an user-friendly and interactive website will eventually allow for more infastructure and more progress to eliminate this disease. My site will be able to produce data in an aesthetically pleasing and interactive way, and would help raise awareness for futher progress in this field.</p>
    
    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    
    <p>The target audience for this website will the the general public, and to generally raise awareness towards Cholera and allow for more progress to be made down this track.</p>

    <h1>Research and Skills</h1>
    
    <p>I will learn more about Javascript, to create an interactive webpage to display data retrieved from the WHO website. I will create and display interactive graphs and charts to raise awareness through a visual and interactive process. Furthermore, I will explore a variety of HTML5 canvas text options and website display options (themes, background, colour, ... etc). Lastly, I seek to make my website ergonomic and accessible to the user, incuding the implementation of dropdowns, visual enhancements, and autocompletion.</p>
    
    <h1>Primary Research Plan</h1>
    
    <p>
    
    1. Explore and learn advanced HTML5 canvas options <br>
    2. Create an interactive graph that become animated when cursor hovers over it <br>
    3. Create buttons and external links that animate when cursor hovers over it <br>
    4. Implementing images that connect with the topic and allows the user to learn visually <br>
    5. Use CSS to create a character (Siri, Alexa) to help guide the user through the website  <br>
    6. Linking my website to a video that can inform the user on the topic of Cholera
        
    </p>
    
    <h1>Secondary Research Plan</h1>
    
    <p>
    
    1. Creations of dropdowns and autocompletions <br>
    2. Using CSS to smoothen the animations and visual features on the website <br>
    3. Implementing a suitable background to contrast the overall theme of the website
