<h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
    
    <p>After analyzing multiple websites that propose a solution to my problem, I have a form of what my website needs to look like in order to provide a personal solution. My website needs to have features of innovation and interaction to connect with the user through the interface. I will design an aesthetically pleasing website, while maintaining the quality of the interactive features.</p>
    
    <h1><u>Design Specifications and Success Criteria</u></h1>
    
    <h2>Interactivity</h2>
    <p><pre>1. Website must include a HTML5 canvas graph that can:<br>
            a) Display multiple countries<br>
            b) Display data in multiple styles (pie chart, bar graph, world graph... etc.)<br>
            c) Animate and display excess information when mouse hovers over each subsection of the graph</pre>
    <h2>Ergonomics</h2>
    <p><pre>2. Website must include filter functions, dropdowns, and autocompletes that sort ".json" data including:<br>
            a) Different countries<br>
            b) Different times periods and dates<br>
            c) External information relating to the topic of Cholera</pre>
    <p><pre>3. Website must include an audio/visual aid to guide the user though the website options include:<br>
            a) A programmed identity (Siri, Alexa) that acts as a tutorial for the website<br>
            b) A search bar for "Help"</pre>
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p><pre>4. Website must include a contrasting and pleasing colour scheme:<br>
            a) Text and other programs should be readable<br>
            b) The colour scheme should not combat the text or the graphs</pre>
    <pre>5. The use of space should not be clumped up; website should look modern, dynamic, and minimalist</pre>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p><pre>6. Website must be able to display information and statistics in a specific way:<br>
            a) Basic information must be displayed automatically on the website<br>
            b) More specific and external information will be found when the user completes a certain action (e.g. hovering the mouse, clicking, searching, ... etc.)</pre>

    <h2>Chosen Design</h2>
    <p>I chose design 2 because it covers more content on the homepage, and contains 3 graphs (trend, bar, world) whereas design 1 only has 2. This featuer will increase the interactivity of my website and help the user understand the problem through the visuals of the graphs. In addition, design 2 looks a lot more organized and less cluttered, whereas design 1 is more disorganized and the information and graphs are spread across the website rather than in a designated section. Moreover, design 2 contains more features which the user can interact with, such as a button that, when hovered, displays facts about Cholera. It also has a linked video so that the user can also learn aurally. There is also a button leading to the WHO data if the viewer wishes to view that data. Also, there is a search bar, that can help guide the user through a series of autocompletion.</p>
